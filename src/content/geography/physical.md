China’s physical geography is among the most diverse on Earth, shaped by immense mountain systems, vast river basins, deserts and fertile plains.

## Major Geographic Regions

### 1. The Tibetan Plateau
Often called *“The Roof of the World”*, this massive high‑altitude region dominates western China. It is the source of Asia’s major rivers, including the Yangtze and Yellow River.

### 2. The East China Plain
China’s agricultural heartland, stretching from the lower Yangtze River to the Yellow River delta. It contains many of China’s largest cities and most fertile farmland.

### 3. The Sichuan Basin
A fertile, humid basin surrounded by mountains, home to Chengdu and one of China’s oldest agricultural regions.

## Major Rivers

### Yangtze (Chang Jiang)
The longest river in Asia and the third longest in the world. It flows eastwards through Wuhan and Shanghai, shaping China’s economy, transport and culture.

### Yellow River (Huang He)
Known as "China’s cradle of civilization", it historically supported early agricultural societies.

## Mountain Systems

- Himalayas – Southern border with India/Nepal
- Tianshan – Central Asia barrier
- Qinling – Climatic border between North and South China

## Climate Zones

China spans:
- Subarctic regions in the northeast
- Temperate zones in central China
