title: Demographics of China
subtitle: People, Cities & Population Patterns
---

China is home to more than 1.4 billion people, making it the most populous country on Earth. Its demographic story is one of rapid urbanisation, regional contrasts and shifting age structures.

## Population Distribution

- **East & Coastline** – Densely populated megacity clusters like the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou) and the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong).
- **Central China** – Large cities along the Yangtze (Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu) and traditional agricultural regions.
- **West & Northwest** – Much lower population density across the Tibetan Plateau, Xinjiang and Qinghai.

## Urban vs Rural

Over the past few decades, China has transformed from a predominantly rural society into an urban one.

- In 1980, most people lived in the countryside.
- Today, more than 60 % of the population lives in cities.
- Massive internal migration has fueled the growth of coastal megacities.

## Age Structure

China’s age structure is changing:

- A shrinking share of young people due to past one‑child policies.
- A growing elderly population, especially in rural areas.
- Pressure on social services, pensions and healthcare systems.

## Ethnic Diversity

While the **Han Chinese** make up the majority, China officially recognises 50 + minority groups, including:

- Zhuang
- Hui
- Manchu
- Uyghur
- Tibetan
- Mongol
- Naxi, Bai and many more in Yunnan

These groups contribute to the country’s linguistic, cultural and religious diversity.

Demographics shape not only China’s economy and politics, but also how different regions feel when you travel: from hyper‑modern megacities to remote, traditional communities.
